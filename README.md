## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/NxNNqNp/download.png)

I've been exploring backend technologies for a while now and having to create something in the frontend refreshes a lot of things in me. The best thing that I've learned in this challenge is to start solve the problem first and refactor. With that approach I've implemented the main logic of this website a faster. I also learned a lot on React Query which handles caching and invalidation on api responses.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Features

- Generates 10 unique question on each request.
- Can retry taking quiz
- Gets their score after completing the questionnaire
- Can see if their answer is correct on each items.

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Bu3G2irnaXmfwQ8sZkw8) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
